# **Web-App-Security-Basic-Overview**

## **Overview**
This is less of a project walkthrough and more of a compilation of resources and basic knowledge on web application vulnerabilities. 

A great place to start regarding web app security is the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), a standard awareness document for developers and security professionals. 

Web app security can run extremely deep (with millions of vulnerabilities out there), but it's important to have a baseline level of knowledge to understand how a hacker might think when attacking a webapp. 

**Some of the most important vulnerabilities in OWASP are:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Command Injection
- Local and Remote File Inclusion (LFI and RFI)
- File Upload Vulnerabilities

## **Top Resources For Learning**
- [Hacksplaining](https://www.hacksplaining.com/lessons) - includes interactive tutorials
- [DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)](http://www.dvwa.co.uk/) - one of the most popular intentionally vulnerable web apps used for security training and education
- [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) - similar to DVWA, but with built in challenges, a whole wiki that provides hints and solutions, and community support.
- [Gruyere](https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/) - similar to DVWA, but easier to access
- [Portswigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) - has interactive labs for learning about web vulnerabilities

## **Notes**

- Just like a lot of things in security, if you have endless free time, you might uncover many of these vulnerabilities manually. Regardless, to save time and ensure efficiency, these attacks are often best carried out by running a web vulnerability scanner that detects  weaknesses by sending hundreds and hundreds of URL iterations to a web system in a short amount of time.
- May be adding some quick explanations of vulnerabilities mentioned above, but it's worth exploring them each individually and in depth. The internet has thousands of tutorials and help pages regarding the major vulnerabilites, and they will help you develop a deeper understanding of them.
